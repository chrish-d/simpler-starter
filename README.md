A (reasonably) unopinionated Gatsby starter, including; Tailwind 2 and
Emotion. Use Tailwind utilities with Emotion powered CSS-in-JS to
produce component scoped CSS (no need for utilities like Purge CSS,
etc).

## 🧪 Installation

1. Use the command below to create a new site with this starter;

```
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/chrish-d/gatsby-starter-tailwind2-emotion-styled-components
```

2. Navigate to the new folder and start developing!

```
cd gatsby-site/
gatsby develop
```

## 🐞 Bugs

- No support for Tailwind Plugins.
